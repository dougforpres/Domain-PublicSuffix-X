Revision history for Domain-PublicSuffix

0.05    2012-01-04 21:00 PST
        - Added Punycode encoding to all data read from config file
          (the config file is encoded in UTF-8, comparisons are done
          assuming ASCII, so was easier to pre-process the data file)
        - Address a problem whereby 3-part suffixes don't seem to work
          properly if there is a wildcard present in an earlier mapping
          for the same parent suffix.
        - Added some handy helper methods that (hopefully) make the API
          easier to understand.
        - Changed default loading mechanism to look for 'effective_tld
          names.dat' in the PublicSuffix dir as last resort instead of
          loading from 'Default.pm' - the copy in Default.pm was old and
          there was some weirdness with the UTF8 in it.  Additionally this
          allows for much easier updating, as all that is required is to
          d/l and save the latest file.

        - Normalized code style
        - Updated default public suffix file to latest from Mozilla
        - Bug fixes, thanks to Jason Wieland --
          - Documentation fixed to show that new requires a hashref
          - Path searching for the tld data file now searches from root
          - Improper code flow after finding a file causes module to
            break when a data file is defined.

        Documentation and namespace fixes, so viewing in CPAN isn't a nightmare.

        First release, likely prone to bugs I haven't even thought of.
