0.04    2008-10-09 11:30 GMT
        - Normalized code style
        - Updated default public suffix file to latest from Mozilla
        - Bug fixes, thanks to Jason Wieland --
          - Documentation fixed to show that new requires a hashref
          - Path searching for the tld data file now searches from root
          - Improper code flow after finding a file causes module to
            break when a data file is defined.
